        This is one of the first things I learned to bake when I was young. I wasn't particularly interested in welding or maching or cars like my brothers, but I did take a liking to cooking.
        This started mostly because I was a bit of a glutton and was always dipping my finger into various batters of dessert my mom was making until I eventually started making things along with her.
        One of the first such dishes were Mississippi Mud Bars. I usually ate as many mini marshmallows as we probably used in the recipe. This was my intro into 
        baking and cooking and I went on to work on the kitchen line. Though it never stuck as a career (mostly due to the absurdly low wages paid to back-of-house kitchen workers), 
        I still love cooking and it gives me memories of home.
