        This is one of the first things I learned to bake when I was young. I wasn't particularly interested in welding or maching or cars like my brothers, but I did take a liking to cooking.
        This started mostly because I was a bit of a glutton and was always dipping my finger into various batters of dessert my mom was making until I eventually started making things along with her.
        One of the first such dishes were Mississippi Mud Bars. I usually ate as many mini marshmallows as we probably used in the recipe. This was my intro into 
        baking and cooking and I went on to work on the kitchen line. Though it never stuck as a career (mostly due to the absurdly low wages paid to back-of-house kitchen workers), 
        I still love cooking and it gives me memories of home.

      I chose the website <a href="ultimate-guitar.com">Ultimate Guitar</a>because it's something I've personally used for many years. 
      The website hosts over a million user-submitted tabs of music. Tabs or tablature have been around since before the renaissance but
      more recently are associated with online websites that host user-generated approximations of popular music. Tabs, more often than not, don't 
      offer exact timing like in standard musical notation. This, as well as the quality of user submissions of tabs varying widely, means
      the most popular and highest quality tabs are chosen by the users of the site by giving a rating and/or leaving comments. Like much
      of the modern internet, I see this as an archive where the material is both submitted and curated using crowdsourcing.

    My final project combines the keywords "Care" and either "Critiquing" or "Framing". I'm particularly focused looking at aspects of
    self-care that can become harmful or toxic to our mental health when taken to the extreme. I made this Gif from Monty Python & the 
    Holy Grail as a tongue-in-cheek way of looking at how many introverts actually thrived in the first two years of the pandemic and 
    were happy to not be drained by social interactions. Now that things are opening back up and people are having go out in person, I 
    think this has had a bit of whiplash effect on many, including myself.
